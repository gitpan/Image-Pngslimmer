Image::Pngslimmer version 0.02
=============================

OVERVIEW

Image::Pngslimmer reduces the size of PNGs by removing non-critcal chunks.

Other tools, such as pngcrush (http://pmt.sourceforge.net/pngcrush/) 
will deliver (much) better results for static PNGs and Image::Pnglimmer 
is specifically designed for dynamically created PNGs.

use Image::Pngslimmer

Image::Pngslimmer::ispng($blob) - returns 1 if the BLOB conforms to the basic
structure for a PNG

Image::Pngslimmer::discard_noncritical($blob) - returns a BLOB stripped of any
non-critcal chunks. If the passed-in BLOB does not conform to the basic structure
of a PNG the returned BLOB is identical to the passed-in BLOB. The passed in BLOB
is not altered by this function.

Image::Pngslimmer::analyze($blob) - after calling Image::Pngslimmer::ispng($blob)
this will iterate through the chunks in the supplied byte stream represented by 
$blob and return an array of strings describing the chunks in the PNG. It can be
useful for testing the "before and after" effect of discard_noncritical($blob).
